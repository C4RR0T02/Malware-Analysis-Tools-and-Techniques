# Introduction to Malware Analysis Tools & Techniques

## Definition of Malware
Malware is a software that is created with a `malicious intent`. It is used to `compromise computer functions`, `steal data`, `bypass access controls` and `cause harm to other host computers`

## Malware Symptoms
- Increased CPU usage
- Device slowing down
- Issues with internet connection
- Freezing / crashing
- Modified / Deleted Files
- New files appera
- Programs running, switched off or reconfigured
- Strange device behavious
- Emails / message sent without knowledge


## Types of Malware

|Malware|Malware Description|
|:---|:---|
|Adware|Type of malware that automatically delivers advertisement (Pop ups)|
|Bot|Program created to automatically perform specific operations|
|Bug|Flaw in a software that produces undesired outcomes. Security bugs are the most severe bugs and allow attackers to deliever exploits|
|Ransomware|Malware that holds computer system captive while demanding ransom|
|Rootkit|Malware to remotely access and control a device without being detected|
|Spyware|Malware to monitor user activity without their knowledge|
|Trojan Horse|Disguises as a normal file to trich users into installing the malware|
|Virus|Attach to files and programs and await for the execution to infect, Self replicating|
|Worm|Spread over the network|

## Overview of MATT
1. Basic Static Analysis
2. Basic Dynamic Analysis
3. Advanced Static Analysis
4. Advanced Dynamic Analysis

Static is not executing malware
Dynamic is executing the malware

### Basic Static Analysis
- Examine executable file without viewing actual instructions
- Can confirm if the file is malicious
- Straightforward and quick
- important behavious can be missed from complex malware

### Basic Dynamic Analysis
- Requires execution of malware 
- Observing the behaviours
- Require safe environment to run malware

### Advanced Static Analysis
- Reverse engineering
- loads executable in a disassembler
- look at the program instructions to discover functions of program
- Steeper learning curve
- require specialized knowledge on disassmbly, code construct and Windows OS

### Advanced Dynamic Analysis
- Execute Malware in a debugger
- View line by line to see what the code does
- Reverse Engineering
- extract detailed information from an executable
- most useful when attempting to gather information with other techniques
