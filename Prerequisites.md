# Introduction to Malware Analysis Tools & Techniques

## Definition of Malware
Malware is a software that is created with a `malicious intent`. It is used to `compromise computer functions`, `steal data`, `bypass access controls` and `cause harm to other host computers`

Static is not executing malware
Dynamic is executing the malware

### Basic Static Analysis
- Examine executable file without viewing actual instructions
- Can confirm if the file is malicious
- Straightforward and quick
- important behavious can be missed from complex malware

### Basic Dynamic Analysis
- Requires execution of malware 
- Observing the behaviours
- Require safe environment to run malware

### Advanced Static Analysis
- Reverse engineering
- loads executable in a disassembler
- look at the program instructions to discover functions of program
- Steeper learning curve
- require specialized knowledge on disassmbly, code construct and Windows OS

### Advanced Dynamic Analysis
- Execute Malware in a debugger
- View line by line to see what the code does
- Reverse Engineering
- extract detailed information from an executable
- most useful when attempting to gather information with other techniques
